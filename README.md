# CompundInterestCalculator
This is the result of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I used in order to make a page that not only can calculate the amount of money made, but also is visually interesting as well. I mostly worked in the color gray because it is a money is a serious topic, so a more colorful approach did not seem as appropriate. This was really the first page I ever made, so I hope you enjoy it.
